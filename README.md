# HyperbolicRacket
Using 2htdp library to graphically represent hyperbolic geometry \n
Current WIP, future goals:
  - Change implementation of drawing curves in poincare disk model (PDM) using a mapping from half-plane to PDM
  - Change implementation of drawing curves in half-plane using lambda functions and 'stepper'
  - Convert to using complex numbers
